Human activity recognition (HAR) has become a crucial research area for many applications,
 such as healthcare and surveillance. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and
 the Internet of Things (IoT), sensor-based HAR has gained increasing attention and presents
 significant advantages over existing methods. Relying solely on existing labeled data may no
t adequately address the challenge of ensuring a model's generalization ability to new data. 
Although existing transfer learning and domain adaptation methods can alleviate this issue,
 these approaches require accessing the testing data during the training phase, which may be
 impractical. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel HAR algorithm named CLEAR as a solution.
 CLEAR achieves high generalization performance on unknown datasets using only training data.
 Furthermore, CLEAR can be directly applied to various target domains without retraining or 
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that CLEAR shows 
superior performance in improving model classification accuracy and generalization ability. 
The results highlight the effectiveness of CLEAR in addressing distribution shift phenomena 
in real-world scenarios, contributing to the advancement of time series data mining.
